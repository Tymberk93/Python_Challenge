## Module 3
### PyBank & PyPoll

* <b> PyBank </b></br>
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

<i>A Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values</i>:</br>
The total number of months included in the dataset</br>
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period</br>
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes</br>
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period</br>
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period</br>
A final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results</br>
</br>
* <b> PyPoll </b></br>
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".

<i>A Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values</i>:</br>
The total number of votes cast</br>
A complete list of candidates who received votes</br>
The percentage of votes each candidate won</br>
The total number of votes each candidate won</br>
The winner of the election based on popular vote</br>
final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results
